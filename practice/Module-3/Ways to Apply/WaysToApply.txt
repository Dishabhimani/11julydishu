In a three ways we can apply the css

1.Inline
-> Apply using style attribute in start tag
-> Inline is most important.

2.Internal
-> Apply using style tag in head tag

3.External
-> Create the CSS file using .css extension and Apply it into HTML file using href attribute in link tag. 
-> According to W3c external css is is more ideal than inline or internal.

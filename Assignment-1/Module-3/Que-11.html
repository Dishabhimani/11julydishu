    <h2>11.What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</h2>
    <h2>Ans:</h2>
    <h4>block-level element:</h4>
    Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go.<br>
    Block elements have top and bottom margins.
    <h4>Inline element:</h4>
    Inline elements never start from a new line. <br>
    Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.

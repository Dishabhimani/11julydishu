    <h2>Que-15 What is the result of the expression (5 > 3 && 2 < 4)? </h2><hr>
    <p>The expression (5 > 3 && 2 < 4) involves two comparisons and a logical AND operator:
        <li>5 > 3 evaluates to true because 5 is greater than 3.</li>
        <li>2 < 4 evaluates to true because 2 is less than 4.</li>
        The logical AND operator (&&) returns true if both operands are true. Since both 5 > 3 and 2 < 4 are true,so the result of the expression (5 > 3 && 2 < 4) is True.</p>

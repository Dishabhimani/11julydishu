    <h2>Que-58 Array vs object defences in JS? </h2>
    <hr>
    <P>In JavaScript, "array" and "object" are both fundamental data structures, but they serve different purposes and
        have different characteristics:</P>
    <h3>Array:</h3>
    <li>Ordered Collection: Arrays are ordered collections of data where each element is identified by an index
        (starting from 0).</li>
    <li>Homogeneous: Arrays typically store elements of the same type (though JavaScript allows mixed types).</li>
    <li>Methods: Arrays come with built-in methods like push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, etc., for manipulating data.
    </li>
    <li>Iteration: They are usually iterated over using loops or array methods like forEach, map, filter, etc.</li>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars;

    </script>
    <h3>Object:</h3>
    <li>Key-Value Pairs: Objects are collections of key-value pairs where each key is unique.</li>
    <li>Unordered: The order of properties in an object is not guaranteed.</li>
    <li>Properties: Besides storing data, objects can also contain methods (functions defined as object properties).</li>
    <li>Access: Properties of an object are accessed using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object['property']).</li>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <!-- <script>
        const person = {};
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue"; 
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
    </script> -->
</body>

    <h2>Que-56 how many type of JS Event? How to use it ?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>JavaScript events come in several types, categorized based on their origin or source. Here are the main types of
        JavaScript events:</p>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Mouse Events: These events occur when a user interacts with the mouse. Examples include click, mouseover,
            mouseout, etc.</li>
        <li>Keyboard Events: These events occur when the user interacts with the keyboard. Examples include keydown,
            keyup, keypress.</li>
        <li>Form Events: These events are related to HTML form elements. Examples include submit, reset, change, focus,
            blur.</li>
        <li>Document/Window Events: These events are related to the loading and unloading of the document or the browser
            window. Examples include load, resize, scroll, unload.</li>
        <li>Event Delegation Events: These events allow handling events on multiple elements using event delegation
            techniques. Examples include delegate, undelegate.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To use these events in JavaScript, you typically attach event listeners to elements in your HTML document. Hereâ€™s
        a basic example:</p>
        <button id="myButton">Click Me!</button>
    <script>
        document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function (event) {
            document.write('Button clicked!');
        });

    </script>
</body>

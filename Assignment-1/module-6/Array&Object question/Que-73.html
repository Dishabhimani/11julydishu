    <h2>Que-73 What is the function of the delete operator?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The delete operator in JavaScript is used to remove a property from an object. If the property is successfully deleted, the delete operator returns true; otherwise, it returns false. It is important to note that the delete operator only works on object properties and has no effect on variables or functions.</p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <h4>Check console.</h4>

    <script>
        const obj = {
  name: 'Yashvi',
  age: 20,
  job: 'Developer'
};

console.log(obj); 
delete obj.age;

console.log(obj);

    </script>
</body>
